The scientific name of the Edible Frog means both \"mud\" and \"guardian\" as they are known to never stray far from water, almost guarding the muddy banks. It was first described in 1758 and has adopted its name as the \"edible\" Frog due to the fact that they are now seen as a culinary delicacy in France, particularly the legs.",

Adult Edible Frogs are mainly green in colour with light patches of brown on their backs, yellow eyes and a white underside, covered in a few dark spots. There are number of distinct differences between males and females including the fact that males become much lighter (and greener) during the mating season. Male Edible Frogs also have vocal sacs on the outside of their cheeks and extra skin patches on their feet, both of which are primarily for mating.",

Southern populations of the Edible Frog are found from Croatia, through northern Italy and into the south of France. There are also isolated populations in Sweden and Bulgaria which are thought to have migrated from the countries nearby. Edible Frogs spend all of their time either in or very close to water and are most commonly found in calmer parts of rivers and streams, where there is a slow but constant flow of fresh water. They are said to prefer more open areas and can also be commonly spotted around lakes, ponds and marshes.",

This is when Edible Frogs are most likely to move away from the water, so that they can find a better supply of food or move to a different part of the water if need be. The Edible Frog is a relatively solitary animal so there is less competition for food but males are often seen sitting together in groups during the breeding season when they are trying to out-compete each other for a mate. Edible Frogs spend a large portion of their time sitting motionless on the muddy banks where they are perfectly camouflaged by their skin colour.
