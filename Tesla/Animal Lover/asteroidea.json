          "desc1": "The starfish (commonly as a sea star) is generally found with 5 arms that are attached to a central disc. This central disc is the activity centre of the starfish and also contains the mouth of the starfish.",
          "desc2": "The starfish feeds on oysters and clams, the 2 stomachs of the starfish helping with the digestion of complex organisms. The starfish uses one stomach to begin the digestion of the food, and the other stomach to expand outwards and engulf their prey. Starfish can be found in the oceans all around the world.",
          "desc3": "Starfish do not rely on a jointed, movable skeleton for support and movement (although starfish are still protected by their skeleton), but instead possess a hydraulic water vascular system that aids the starfish in movement."
