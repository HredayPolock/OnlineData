          "desc2": "The general age range for most species of scorpion is between 6 months and 25 years, although the actual lifespan of most species of scorpion is unknown as they are very elusive animals in the wild and are often hard to spot due to their generally small size.",
          "desc3": "For the majority of the time, when a human is stung by a scorpion, the symptoms are often similar to those of a bee sting and are often just swollen and painful. However, around 50 scorpion species are thought to carry enough venom that could cause more serious harm to humans and around half of those 50 scorpion species are believed to be capable of causing fatal results when having stung a human being."

          "desc1": "There are three main species of black widow spider, all of which have very similar characteristics and inhabit areas in Northern America and parts of Mexico. Until very recently all three species of black widow spider were classified as one but recent research shows that as the species inhabit different areas, the three species of black widow spider have adapted to their environment in different ways.",
          "desc2": "The Northern black widow spider is primarily found in the north east of the USA and parts of south east Canada, although the range of the northern black widow spider overlaps with that of the western black widow spider a great deal.",
          "desc3": "The black widow spider typically preys on a variety of insects, but occasionally they do feed upon woodlice and other arachnids. The black widow spider waits until prey has been trapped in its web before they quickly run out of their den, wrap it up and bite it. The venom from the bite of the black widow spider takes about ten minutes to take effect so the prey is held tightly by the spider. When the prey of the black widow spider has stopped moving, digestive enzymes are released into the wound where the black widow spider originally bit it. The black widow spider then carries its prey back to its retreat before feeding."

          "desc2": "The red knee tarantula inhabits the complex scrub-forest habitat and semi-desert regions where there is an abundance of food. The red knee tarantula needs to burrow and so is rarely found on rock faces.",
          "desc3": "The female red knee tarantula lays an average of 40 eggs which are laid in a silk sack generally between the months of May and August. The red knee tarantula babies hatch out of their eggs in about a month and it takes the red knee tarantula babies nearly a year to reach adulthood."
